The MvnBuild native step performs a Maven project build on files in a Git repository. Optionally, it can also publish build information to Artifactory.

This sample shows you how to build a simple Java application and deploy the resultant artifact to Artifactory.

Detailed instructions on how to run this sample, as well as explanation of the configuration, is in the JFrog Pipelines Quickstart documentation: [Pipelines Example: Build a Maven project](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Pipelines+Example%3A+Maven+Build).
